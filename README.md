\# 32-bit ALU in Verilog



This repository contains a 32-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) implemented in Verilog.



\## Current Implementation

\- Ripple-carry based ALU

\- Modular design:

&nbsp; - ripple\_adder.v

&nbsp; - logic\_unit.v

&nbsp; - shifter.v

\- Self-checking testbench included



\## Supported Operations

\- Addition

\- Subtraction

\- Logical operations (AND, OR, XOR)

\- Shift operations



\## Notes

\- This is the initial version (ripple-carry based).

\- Future work will include optimization and full ALU enhancements.
